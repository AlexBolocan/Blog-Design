                but so so so many UIs get it wrong. I see this frequently enough that, rather than complain about 
                them individually, I though I'd just write down the set of rules they often break.

                   but thre should be a good reason for breaking on of these rules(for example, some of these rules don't
                    apply if a field must be filled with a value from a fixed set, like the list of US states). Following these
                   rules in at very least a sane experience:
